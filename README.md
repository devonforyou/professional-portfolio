# Devon's Showcase
## Description
- This project focused on creating a web application with no starter code.
- It allowed me to practice setting up my html and styling it all with css.
- I ran into a lot of issues here and there but this was great practice for me to debug my own code.
- This application is used to showcase the work I've done and allow me to continue practicing.
