# Devon's Showcase
## Description
- This project focused on creating a web application with no starter code.
- It allowed me to practice setting up my html and styling it all with css.
- I ran into a lot of issues here and there but this was great practice for me to debug my own code.
- This application is used to showcase the work I've done and allow me to continue practicing.

## Usage
With this application, I am able to add more work I do in the future and have this as my portfolio. It's a good base portfolio that I can always look back on and improve as I learn more coding languages and techniques.
